# Do as It Says
## Overview
"Do as It Says" is a horror game developed to be submitted to the Global Game Jam (USP), under the theme "**Make Me Laugh**". The concept revolves around interpreting the theme as a commanding order: "_Make me laugh, it's an order!_". Although the jam has come to an end, I will continue to improve the game until it reaches a level that I am satisfied with.

## Concept
In this game, players face a challenge as they receive and fulfill orders from an evil shadow. The tasks become progressively more unsettling, as well as the environment and atmosphere. Every time the player finishes a task, the shadow's smile gets bigger and weirder.

## Objective
To finish the game, you have to complete all of the missions within the given timeframe.
